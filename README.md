## What Im currently working on
- determining with AI Model to use

**NOTE**: I haven't used AI before so this process might take some time as learning from the documentation takes some time

## To-Do:
- Clean Code/Fix Bugs
- Create Test/Edge Cases
- Create better documentation
- Create an app using FlutterFlow
- Work on implementing more features

## Plan:

I am currently a University Student so I will work on this whenever I have the time however I aim to incoporate a new function or clean code once per day.

The goal is to have this done by August - September 2024 or early 2025
