## What is this Repo
Genshin Impact: Assistant is a project that will utilize OpenAI and EnkaNetworks API in order to give users based recommendations for their in-game characters tailored for them.

## What Im currently working on
- Clean Code/Fix Bugs
- Create Test/Edge Cases

**UPDATE (6/11/24)**: Switching direction from OpenAI API -> Gemini API since OpenAI isnt free to use

**UPDATE (6/13/24)**: The AI is functional however it might output incorrect answers. However it works as intended and the information outputted is quite stable

## To-Do:
- Create better documentation

## Future Plans:
- Create an app
- Work on implementing more features

## Plan:

I am currently a University Student so I will work on this whenever I have the time however I aim to incoporate a new function or clean code once per day.

The goal is to have this done by August - September 2024 or early 2025
